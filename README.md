# Recurrent-Neural-Network-Sum-of-digits-in-a-number
Addition of Two numbers using RNN Tensorflow

This model is inspired by a blog post on RNN by Rajiv Shash and his code (http://projects.rajivshah.com/blog/2016/04/05/rnn_addition/)
The code is written in Tensorflow and the model inputs data in batches of 50, (digit after digit). 
It uses the seq2seq method of tensorflow and outputs the sum more or less near the expected answer.
